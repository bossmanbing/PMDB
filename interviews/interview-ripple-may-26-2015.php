		<h4>Ripple interview - 5:00pm EST, 5/25/14</h4>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Hey Ripple, mind introducing yourself for us?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I am Ripple, and I hail from the Midwest. I got my start in Smash in general in ‘05 when it was on the MLG circuit.  My brother was on a Halo team and I wanted to compete as well.  I found Smash to be more appealing than Halo, and I haven't stopped playing since.  I started playing PM right before Big House 3.  I had played it a couple times before that but didn't have an interest in it until after that.</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Where did you get your Smash tag from? (thanks reddit user /u/yonoober!)</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I chose my tag as Ripple in 2006 when a Magic the Gathering set called Coldsnap had just been released.  One of the abilities in the set was called Ripple and I loved playing around this ability.  Before that I had went by the tags “Boogeyman” and “Roanoke” but didn't care for them much.  Ripple just worked.</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> You’re known for your lethal King Dedede. DDD isn't exactly the most popular character - what attracted you to him, and when did you know he was your guy?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I've always been a fan of the characters that are very heavy in smash, playing Samus and DK in Melee and DK in Brawl. I naturally gravitated toward DDD in some sense. I also seem to like to play lower tier and/or less popular characters. Becoming a well known name with a popular character is great, but to pick a lower tier or less popular character and becoming known as THE player for that character (like Axe with Pikachu) is what appeals to me. DDD just happened to fit everything I like. I knew he was my guy for sure after Shuffle V or VI (I forget) when I got top 8 at huge Midwest regional going mostly DDD with the likes Zero, M2k, and Hbox there.</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Tell us a bit more about the penguin. How do you think DDD compares with the rest of the cast, and what are some favorable and not-so-favorable matchups?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> This is an interesting issue for me because I cannot pinpoint exactly how good DDD is compared to the cast. He fares extremely well against most of the popular and higher-tier characters, such as spacies and the FE characters. However, he does lose some MUs pretty badly to some middle-tier characters, with Ivy being near impossible to win.  I don't really have an answer but If I can keep doing well at nationals, then he's at least viable in some sense and that's good enough for me.  As far as the MUs I love/Hate;  I absolutely love playing against Falcon and Marth, and hate playing against Falco, Pika, and Diddy.  </p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Is there anything you’d like to be changed in 3.6 for the King?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> Changes to 3.6 that'd I'd like are few in number. I'd like inhale to be much less committal than it currently is (77 frames minimum compared to Kirby's 49). I'd like for d-tilt to have a lot less cool down since it is currently useless, and finally I'd like his power shield ratio to be slightly better so he can actually reflect projectiles. I don't care about shield size since I manage to make that work but the PS bubble increase is what I want</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Do you think it’s fair to say, at this point, you are the best Dedede in Project M?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> Yes, without a doubt. </p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Anything you want to say to your competition for that title?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> Big D, Smur, Apollo Ali, Captain Birdman, and Heysuess - you all better step it up.</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> So, one of your biggest strengths as a player seems to be your phenomenal placing at nationals, such as:</p>
	<ul class='int-question'>
		<li>Big House 4 - 7th, beating HBox and Oro</li>
		<li>Aftershock - 9th, beating Strongbad and Westballz</li>
		<li>Shuffle 7 - 3rd, beating SoulPech, HankyPanky, and Tetraflora</li>
	</ul>
<p class='int-question'>How have you achieved these great results? Do you have a dedicated practice regiment, or is it just playing up for the big stage?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I rarely put time into actual playing practice actually; most of my training is mental, and includes watching tons of videos and theory crafting. But I definitely think the big stage plays a big role in my placing.  My best is brought out when the other bests are around.  </p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> What is your favorite or most memorable set?

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I'd probably say beating Hbox at BH4. It was such a close set between us, and the fact that I won told me that I could compete with top caliber players for sure and that I'm not relying on gimmicks or anything like that.

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> What tournaments can we expect to see you and the beige King at in the near future? </p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I'm attending Dismantle which is coming up this weekend (May 30th).  I’m also probably going to Smash and Splash over the summer, and you’ll be able to see me at Tipped Off 11 as well. I'm not sure if I'm going to any of the big 4th of July tournaments like Heatwave though.  </p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Are there any big names you’re looking to put on the Ripple Tournament Hitlist?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> The people on my hitlist are Axe, M2K, and Sethlon. Despite seeing them at a couple events, they have eluded me. </p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> PM is a game fueled by regional rivalry. In your mind, what scenes are underrated, what scenes are overrated, and if you had to decide, what scene is the best?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I'd have to say that a sleeper region is definitely the Mass. scene. Their average player skill is actually very high in my opinion.  They might not have as many killers as some places but their average is higher than normal. The most overrated is probably my very own Chicago scene. The best is Texas, for sure.</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> While we’re here, are there any players that are fraudulent, or any underrated players you want to shoutout? </p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I don't have any frauds in mind but a definite hidden boss is ORLY in the Chicago scene.  I don't think he'd travel for just PM but he does practice and enjoy playing it</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Is there anything you struggle with as a player that you’re working on?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I struggle tons with trying to find a character that I can have as a secondary for bad MUs.  No character can really be played the way I play. Kirby can be to some extent, but dies too early for my liking.  </p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> What are your personal goals for the future?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> The only goal I have for the future is to keep getting better and giving people a good show.</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> Thanks for sitting down for us today Ripple. Where can people find you at?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> If people want to talk to me they can find me on Facebook (Blake Catsby), Twitter (@ripple884), Skype (ripplemelee884), or send me a message on smashboards (Ripple).</p>

<p class='int-question'><strong>PoS:</strong> That’s all for my questions, thanks for your time. Is anything you want to leave the readers with?</p>

<p class='int-response'><strong>Rip:</strong> I want to tease you guys that I am making a D3 guide and it'll be out soon<sup>TM</sup></p>

<p class='int-response'>Shoutouts to Apollo Ali, the NZA, and Pooch. Pooch4mod</p>
