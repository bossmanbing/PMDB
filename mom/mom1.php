	<h2>Mind Over Meta 1 - Staggered-Hit Game (Originally Published 11/18/2014)</h2>

	<h4>A Small Preface</h4>

	<p>When I started Mind over Meta, I had no idea just how much the community would enjoy it, how many wonderful people I would come to know, or how much it would affect my life.</p>

	<p>The Smash community has truly become a second family to me, and there's nobody else I'd rather be writing these for. Along the way, I've met countless individuals that have not only helped, but I now am glad to consider friends. OrangeGluon, Hien, PortableSoup, Ephile, Archer, Yonoober, L_Pag, and SmashCapps, I'd like to thank you all specifically for contributing to this series, through the 21 (and counting!) articles. I'd also like to thank Dakpo, who originally inspired these posts after his AMA, and the /r/ssbpm community, which has not only improved my own play, but has been a lovely audience for the MoM series.</p>

	<p>I'm glad to announce that Mind over Meta is partnered with Project M: Database, and you'll be able to see any future articles - as well as some extra content - posted on there in addition to the weekly posts which will be continuing on the subreddit. Further more, all previous articles will be posted on PMDB as well. PMDB is a project of passion for the PM community, and I'm excited for the great things in store, for both PMDB and the greater Project M community.</p>

	<p>To anyone who's supported the MoM series so far - whether it be writing, sharing, talking about, or even just reading it - I am eternally grateful for your support, and I look forward to creating some fantastic content for this second family of mine.</p>

	<p>For the MoM Writing team, thank you for everything,</p>

	<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

	<p><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/2mowb5/mind_over_meta_1_staggeredhit_game/">Original article can be found here.</a></em></p>

	<p>Hi everyone, my name is PlayOnSunday. You may not know me, and that's because I'm a casual scrub that has almost no qualifications or reason to be writing these guides other than I love the subject matter. However, here I am! I'm a Ganon main out of Eastern PA, and have been playing Smash casually since <em>Melee's</em> release and playing competitively for nearly a year now.</p>

	<p>Like many of you, I've had mental blocks and breakthroughs. Wavedashing, moonwalking, l-canceling, etc. etc. etc. I've learned it all, or I'm still learning it. A large appeal of the <em>Smash</em> games to me has been finding these mental blocks and overcoming them through techskill, thought, and practice. However, after playing for so long, I'm starting to see <em>Smash</em> as a different game, one where mental stamina, clarity, and mind games play a larger part than previously thought, and as such, I'll be discussing certain aspects of the mental game of smash in these posts, hoping to both teach newer players, and learn from more experienced players.</p>

	<p>Please take note: I am <strong>not</strong> claiming to be an expert on any of these subjects or Smash as a whole. The point of these posts is to both shine some light on the more mental side of <em>Smash</em> as well as inspiring new content and interesting discussions on this sub. If I make a mistake or you would like to bring to light a new point of view, please feel free to comment, and I will edit these posts as needed.</p>

	<p>Now that we're done with that lengthy intro, let's get started on our first subject.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>STAGGERED-HIT GAME</h4>

	<p><em><strong>There are but two powers in the world, the sword and the mind. In the long run the sword is always beaten by the mind.</strong></em></p>

	<p><em>- Napoleon Bonaparte</em></p>

	<p>Awhile back I read a fantastic guide for <strike>3.02</strike> 2.5 DK written by PMBR member and DK player Strongbad. <a target="_blank" href="http://smashboards.com/threads/ape-academy-an-in-depth-guide-on-project-m-donkey-kong.335542/">If you have the time, I urge you to give it a read, as it's wonderfully written and teaches the game well.</a> While my DK is far from perfect, one part of the article stuck with me, a gamestate Strongbad took to calling "Staggered-Hit Game" (being staggered, staggering, etc.) Originally attributed to KibyKaze, here's the blurb from his post.</p>

	<p><blockquote>As you delve deeper into competitive Project M you will learn that not every neutral-game exchange leads into a true combo, even at lower percents. Often, you will find that instead of landing yourself a grab -> stuff or similar, you've hit your opponent and now you can't get anything guaranteed, but there's something unique about your opponents situation.</blockquote></p>

	<p><blockquote>They have just been hit and they either legitimately do not have all of their options available to them (a tech-chase situation or you've knocked them into the air), or <strong>psychologically they don't want to do much (or sometimes, what they want to do is kind of stupid and easily punishable) because of the hit they've just suffered.</strong></blockquote></p>

	<p><blockquote><strong>I refer to this situation as being staggered.</strong> This is important to mention because, due to the comparative lack of options at your opponents disposal, <strong>getting another hit takes significantly less work to earn, so getting good at recognizing and taking advantage of these situations is crucial with any character</strong> and especially DK.</blockquote></p>

	<p>I found this aspect of the game interesting, and found it popping up more and more as I played and continued to practice and get better. However, what inspired this post <a target="_blank" href=http://www.reddit.com/r/SSBPM/comments/2mkjj2/amondays_week_2_dakpo/>was a post in Dakpo's recent AMA.</a> When asked by <a target="_blank" href=https://www.reddit.com/u/DelanHaar6>/u/DelanHaar6</a> "how do you judge what time is right to go for a big roll punish?" Dakpo responded:</p>

	<p><blockquote>Confidence is the biggest thing. You have to project your confidence onto the other player before the match even begins. You can do it in match by getting really clean punishes and playing decently aggressive. <strong>This makes opponents second guess themselves. <em>I personally look for that golden moment when my opponent does not want to keep fighting me up close and wants to try to reset back into neutral. That's when people panic and roll</em></strong></blockquote></p>

	<p>So now we start to see the pattern. Staggering is something I believe to be not only common to all <em>Smash</em> games, but pivotal in each of them, as being able to better capitalize off of an opponent's disadvantage both in the game and in the mental aspect will improve overall play and win players games. In fact, if you've ever heard phrases like "mindreader," "in his head," or "mindgamed," chances are staggering will be involved somewhere.</p>

	<p>In the next sections, I'm going to go a bit more in depth into what happens when someone is staggered, and in my opinion, how to better punish a staggered opponent, as well as get out of staggered situations yourself.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>STAGGERING IN-DEPTH</h4>

	<p>So, by definition (from Strongbad's Guide), staggering is one or multiple of the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Our opponents are in a physical disadvantaged position, including, but not limited to:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Standard (not knocked down, but being hit or approached)</li>
			<li>Knockdown</li>
			<li>"Aerial Chase"/Above You (not by their choice of course)</li>
			<li>On the ledge or offstage</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Our opponents are under mental duress and making poor decisions, possibly such as:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Shielding</li>
			<li>Rolling</li>
			<li>Spotdodging</li>
			<li>Counterattacking/Countering</li>
			<li>Grabbing (if the stagger is purely psychological, such as a shielded or crouch canceling opponent)
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<hr />
	<h4>STAGGERING OPPONENTS</h4>

	<p>Again, from Strongbad's guide, we learn that many combos start or end in the staggered state. Once an opponent is staggered, there are a few options one may take to punish. However, please note, none of these are end-all be-alls, so use what you feel comes naturally:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Hard Read</li>
	</ul>

	<p><blockquote>Most useful against opponents you know well, whether it be a former training partner or the last game of a bo5, you may get a good feel for opponent's most used (if unintentional) staggered option. I find many opponents tend to roll away when KDS (Knockdown Staggered), so I tend to opt for the read to dair, if playing as Ganon. I predict a shield grab from an opponent who was SDS (Standard Staggered)? I may opt for a spotdodge followed promptly by a jab. This is by far the most situational of the punishes, but also potentially the most devastating.</blockquote></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Soft Read</li>
	</ul>

	<p><blockquote>To keep this short, similar to the hard read, but going after it may not be as punishing, with the tradeoff being you won't get as good of a punish. For example, missing the up-air as a Pikachu on a KDS opponent above you. You still have ACS (Aerial Chase Stagger) on them, but you missed the first opportunity to convert.</blockquote></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Option Coverer</li>
	</ul>

	<p><blockquote>A pattern I found in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7MYdNq3mQ&list=UUConkayXzDDEEB3oULeLtHw">AXE's breakdown of his 4-60 on Silentwolf</a> was he always used the move that covered the most options. This is a great tool, especially against KDS opponents, as only so many moves will truly punish you, most will only reset to neutral. By covering as many options as possible (for example, if KDS, Tech, Tech Right, Tech Left, Miss Tech) you put yourself in a great position to start a true string by guessing correctly. The safest of the options, but also the one most likely to result in a missed read (other than, well, the hard read).</blockquote></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Intimidator</li>
	</ul>

	<p><blockquote>Sometimes, the best option is fear. If opponents wait on the ground, waiting for you to approach, or if you have been approaching with dash attacks, sometimes just getting in their heads will send them flying. If you've been approaching with dash attacks, reading the stagger as a backroll might mean you keep running and grab them out of invincibility. They're laying on the ground. Wait. Make them fear you. Force them to do something they'd never do, them punish them for it. It's a stagger within the stagger, sorta. The most unlikely to come up in top tier play, but definitely an option.</blockquote></p>

	<p>There are infinitely many more options, but this is a fine start. To reiterate, this is all about mental reads and finesse. There is no "right option," it's all about learning to read and deal with stagger to properly punish opponents.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>BEING STAGGERED</h4>

	<p>Being staggered is a much shorter topic. It comes down to a rock-paper-scissors match-up vs. the option your opponent has chosen.</p>

	<p>First things first, <em>ALWAYS KEEP CALM.</em> Being panicked does nothing but force you to instinctively make a bad decision. Keep cool, and use your brain.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Vs. The Hard Read - Mix it up, simple. They think they have you beat mentally, prove them wrong. Make the right choice, simple as that, you'll know what it is. The soft read is the same thing, but then you must get out of the secondary stagger, so I'm grouping it in here.</li>
		<li>Vs. The Option Coverer - Take the lesser evil. You may get roughed up, but taking 40% is much better than losing the stock. Try to put yourself in a position to escape if they mess up, or DI to safety. This is also the safest option in general, except against a Hard Read, where they can punish you if you are predictable.</li>
		<li>Intimidation is you vs. them, mind game. Don't let them psyche you out, and change your patterns to stop them from bullying you.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Something else I'd like to cover: when being combo'd, <em>try to enter a staggered state.</em> This forces a faceoff between your options and their reads, where a success option will get you to safety. And of course, not all stagger was created equal - KDS is better most of the time than ACS in my opinion, for example.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>FINAL REMARKS</h4>

	<p>Thanks for reading to the end! I find staggered states in every game I play now, and I found that better understanding them allowed me to force more on my opponent, and move in when I smell blood in the water. I hope this improved your game, and I can't wait to see some discussion :)</p>

	<p>Thanks, and until next time, may you always punish and never be read,</p>
