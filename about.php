    <p>
      Welcome to Database Project M, an effort to provide a hub of content about Project M and Project M scenes around the world. Database Project M is a collaboration for the community of Super Smash Brothers: Project M, by the community of Project M. We hope this becomes a central location for distributing information and discussion to members of the Project M community.
    </p>

    <p>Our primary goals in this project are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Integrate the community on a national level. By becoming an axis of Project M discussion, similar to that on the <a href='https://reddit.com/r/ssbpm' target='_blank'>Project M subreddit</a> and <a href='http://smashboards.com/categories/project-m.465/' target='_blank'>the Project M forum on Smashboards</a>. To move toward this goal, we aim to…
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Inspire growth of the community and quality content creation by promoting local, regional, and national Project M scenes, players in those scenes, and various forms of media about Project M. This includes publicizing small and large streams and channel for events, advertising tournaments, promoting community gameplay videos, podcasts like TheSaltMines, and much more. And we want to give you a chance in the spotlight through our efforts to...
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Keep track of players. We want to have a central system for getting information about various players in small and large scenes to compare competitors and inspire rivalries. This way, your efforts can become noticed as you struggle to climb the ranks at tournaments large and small, and your spotlight will drive you to improve your game. And we will keep your enthusiasm strong with our focus to…
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Produce content for hype. This includes articles on various scenes, interviews with various large- and growing-scale personalities, guides from our writing team and others on topics that may vary from tournament-running advice to character-specific manifestos. And, as mentioned before, we will be promoting Project M events, discussions about the game, and much more through the content produced for Database Project M.
      </li>
    </ul>
      <p>
        The site is still under development, so we will be improving it even more over the next few months. However, we do intend to produce content regularly, so keep checking back in with us as we add to Database Project M. We look forward to helping the Project M community, at every scale, continue to grow and connect on a grand scale.
      </p>

<p>Thanks for being with us,<br />
Database Project M Team.</p>
